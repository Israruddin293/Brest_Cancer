Breast Cancer Classification with Gaussian Naïve Bayes
Mini Project for ML Diagnostics

📝 Description
A machine learning project to classify breast tumors as Malignant (cancerous) or Benign (non-cancerous) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset. Built with Python and Scikit-learn.

🛠️ Installation
Install Python Libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
Download the Dataset:

Save the dataset as dataset.csv in your project folder.

🚀 Usage
Run the script:

python breast_cancer_classifier.py
Expected Output:

Accuracy: 0.9474
Precision: 0.9412
Recall: 0.9756
F1-Score: 0.9581
A confusion matrix plot will auto-generate.
